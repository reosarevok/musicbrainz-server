# ocharles introduced this bit of horrible code, because of Selenium. When we
# run selenium.t, it forks and starts up a new Catalyst server. This should
# share the same connection as the parent thread, so the parent can set up a
# transaction and test data.
#
# The real solution here is to patch Test::WWW::Selenium::Catalyst so that it
# can have init and tear down functions.

=attribute utf8_decoded

Returns the URL, with entities unescaped and the string decoded from utf-8 into
a Perl string. If the decoding fails, then the URL is probably not in utf-8
encoding, and `undef` is returned.

=method pretty_name

Return a human readable display of this URL. This is usually the URL with
character entities unescaped, however we only do this if the encoding is UTF-8.
If decoding fails, the URL is displayed as it is in the database, complete with
character entities.
